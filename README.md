# Sunshine

This app is made along with the Udacity course named [Developing android Apps]. 
The code itself is similar to the example on the udacity repository.

Basically, the app uploads JSON file from the web on start or when you press "Refresh".
That file contains weather data according to the formed URI. The app forms the URI according to the settings and parses the data. It is stored in the local DB and displayed as you can see on the screenshots below.
The 'main' and 'details' views are combined in one for tablets (check the screenshots).
One can change the location, invoke Map app or share the data with friends through the options menu on the top right.

And that's how it looks like on a phone:
